# AGV-MDP
The official code repository for the AGV-MDP project. 

The AGV-MDP project is an SP Iconic Project. The project automates factory processes, and interconnects manufacturing machines. This boosts productivity in manufacturing plants, and simplifies troubleshooting. 

This project is worked on by many Singapore Polytechnic students and lecturers.
